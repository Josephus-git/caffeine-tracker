## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/josephus-git/FrontEnd.git
    cd FrontEnd/coffee-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    -   Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Add a new Web App to your project to get your Firebase configuration.
    -   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase configuration keys. It's common to prefix these with your framework's convention (e.g., `REACT_APP_` or `VITE_`).
        ```env
        # Example for Create React App
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        ```
    -   Enable the Firebase AI API (`firebasevertexai.googleapis.com`) in your Firebase project console.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port depending on your setup).
